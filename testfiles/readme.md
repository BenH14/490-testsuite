# Test Files

Each assignment is stored in a different directory, with `in/` holding the input files, `out/` holding your program's actual output, and `std/` holding the expected output.

If you're adding your own custom test files, its probably a good idea to prefix them with your usename (or something else unique) so that someone else doesn't accidentaly overwrite it.
